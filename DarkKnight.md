Batman

 Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

 I'm Batman I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. No guns, no killing. It's ends here. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

 This isn't a car. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

 It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
